								<p class="c-text_03 c-bold">The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act requires that beginning January 1, 2012, retail sellers and manufacturers with annual worldwide gross receipts over $100 million doing business in the state disclose their efforts to eradicate human slavery and trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale. The Act requires that the information be posted on the company's website, with a conspicuous link on the company's homepage.</p>
								<p class="c-text_03 c-bold">The company must disclose its specific actions in relation to five key points, as described in the Act:</p>
								<p class="c-text_03"><span class="c-bold">Training:</span> Do you train your employees directly responsible for supply chain management on mitigating the risk of slavery and human trafficking in your supply chain?</p>
								<p class="c-text_03">We do conduct such training. Employees directly responsible for procurement and supply chain management are trained on such issues as forced labor and child labor.</p>
								<p class="c-text_03"><span class="c-bold">Certification:</span> Do you require your direct suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated into your product comply with the local laws on slavery and human trafficking?</p>
								<p class="c-text_03">We do require that our suppliers certify that they comply with those laws of the country in which they operate relating to child labor and forced labor / slavery. We have an ongoing program requiring written agreement from all our direct suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding forced labor and child labor.</p>
								<p class="c-text_03"><span class="c-bold">Verification:</span> Do you engage in third-party verification; have you identified the risk of slavery and human trafficking in your supply chain?</p>
								<p class="c-text_03">We do not yet engage in 3rd party verification.</p>
								<p class="c-text_03"><span class="c-bold">Auditing:</span> Do you engage in independent, unannounced auditing to check on adherence to your company standards on slavery and human trafficking?</p>
								<p class="c-text_03">We do not at this time engage in such independent, unannounced auditing. However, we intend to review our practices in this regard and explore the use of third-party auditors at least with respect to any suppliers operating in high risk territories.</p>
								<p class="c-text_03"><span class="c-bold">Internal accountability:</span> Are you holding your employees and contractors accountable to your company standards on slavery and human trafficking?</p>
								<p class="c-text_03">We do have internal standards embodied in our corporate code of conduct and violations of such code can lead to disciplinary action.</p>

<span class="c-bold">1. Privacy.</span>
Individuals may participate in the Program to recommend services or content made available by Company to their friends, family or colleagues ("Users").  To do this, Users must necessarily submit personal information about themselves and their friends, family members or colleagues, such as name and e-mail address information, so that the Company and Service Provider can send these recommendations on their behalf.  The personal information will be collected, processed and used in accordance with Company’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at https://www.shiseido.com/privacy.html for Shiseido Cosmetics and https://www.cledepeaubeaute.com/page-privacy-policy/page-privacy-policy.html for Clé de Peau Beauté, and Service Provider’s Privacy Policy which can be found at https://www.extole.com/privacy-policy. In addition, personal information may be used by Company and Service Provider to contact Users with regards to their participation in the Program and to receive communications from Company.   Where a User provides personal information about its friends, family members or colleagues to receive communications via the Program, the provided personal information will be used by the Company and Service Provider for sending these communications on behalf of the User. User understands that Company and Service Provider may send out additional follow-up communications on behalf of the User to encourage or remind the friends, family members or colleagues to complete the purchase.
<span class="c-bold">2. How the Program Works. </span>
<span class="c-bold">Program Participation, Generally</span>
Users who refer are called "Referrers."  Individuals who receive a referral are called "Referred Customers."  An "eligible" Referrer who is fully compliant with these Terms and Conditions may receive a "Reward" for each "Qualified Referral."
To participate, visit referral.shiseido.com and referral.cledepeaubeaute.com and follow the on-screen instructions to refer friends, family members or colleagues to the Service by entering their names and email addresses in the "Refer A Friend" box or by sharing to your Facebook or Twitter accounts.
<span class="c-bold">Eligible Referrer</span>
To be "eligible," a Referrer must:
1.	be a legal resident of the United States of America; and
2.	be at least 16 years old.
Employees of the Company, its Service Provider or any of its or their subsidiaries, affiliates or promotional agencies, including immediate family and household members, are not eligible.
<span class="c-bold">Making a Referral</span>
An individual is required to provide his/her email address but is not required to register, sign-in or make a purchase at the Website in order to make a referral.  Each Program invitation sent by a Referrer to friends, family members or colleagues must clearly state that the Referrer is eligible to receive a Reward if the Referred Customer makes a qualifying purchase. If a Referrer does not clearly state this, it is a violation of these Program terms and may result in Referrer’s immediate termination from the Program, disqualification from future participation, and forfeiture of any Reward owed to the Referrer as a result of Referrer’s participation in this Program. Once an individual refers a friend, family member or colleague, he/she becomes a Referrer and will be assigned a unique referral link ("Personal Link") that allows the Referrer to receive a Reward for each Qualified Referral.  Personal Links will be issued only to individuals.
Referrers must respect the spirit of the Program by only referring real individuals who meet the requirements of these Terms and Conditions.  Referrers cannot refer themselves.  For example, a Referrer may not create multiple or fake accounts with Shiseido Cosmetics or Clé de Peau Beauté or participate in the Program using multiple or fake email addresses or identities.
<span class="c-bold">Qualified Referrals</span>
A Qualified Referral means that all the following conditions are met:
1.	The Referred Customer completed a purchase at www.shiseido.com or //www.cledepeaubeaute.com (the "Website") associated with the Referrer’s "Personal Link."  If a Referred Customer makes a purchase on the Website using any other link or method, the registration will not count as a Qualified Referral and the Referrer will not earn a Reward. Purchases made by a Referred Customer at Company’s boutiques or outlets will not count as a Qualified Referral and the Referrer will not earn a Reward;
2.	The Referred Customer has not placed an order on the Website between November 1, 2016 and November 1, 2017;
3.	The Referred Customer is a) a legal resident of the United States of America and b) at least 16 years old; and
4.	Only one Qualified Referral can be earned for each Referred Customer. Any additional or subsequent purchases made by a Referred Customer will not be Qualified Referrals. A Referrer may not earn more than 100 Qualified Referrals during the operation of the Program.
<span class="c-bold">Rewards for Qualified Referrals</span>
Rewards can only be awarded for Qualified Referrals.
<span class="c-bold">Earning and Using Rewards</span>
Referrer will receive an email with one (1) redemption code ("Code") for $20 off  of a minimum $100 order ("Reward") for Shiseido Cosmetics and $25 off of a minimum $150 order for Clé de Peau Beauté for each verified Qualified Referral generated by Referrer. The $20 off of a minimum $100 and $25 off of a minimum $150 order discount will not apply to charges for shipping, duty and taxes. Referrer will receive an email with the Code approximately 7 days after a Qualified Referral has been verified by Shiseido Cosmetics or Clé de Peau Beauté.  A Referrer may not earn more than 100 Qualified Referrals during the operation of the Program.
To redeem the Reward, enter the Code in the promo code box during checkout at the Website. The Code cannot be used with any other promotional codes and only one Code can be used per order. The Reward and the Code only apply to purchases at the Website and cannot be used in the Company’s boutiques or outlets. All taxes, duty and shipping fees apply to each order placed at the Website and the Code does not reduce the charges for taxes, duty or shipping. The Code does not have an expiration date.
<span class="c-bold">Verified Qualified Referrals</span>
Rewards are subject to verification.  The Company may delay a Reward for the purposes of investigation.  The Company may also refuse to verify and process any transaction the Company deems, in its sole discretion, to be fraudulent, suspicious, in violation of these Terms and Conditions, or believes will impose potential liability on Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents.
All of the Company's decisions are final and binding, including decisions as to whether a Qualified Referral or Reward is verified.
<span class="c-bold">Transfer and Value of Rewards</span>

<span class="c-bold">10. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES</span>
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. ARBITRATION IS A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO BRING SUIT IN COURT.
THIS SECTION CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
IF YOU ARE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:
<span class="c-bold">WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE: </span> You and the Company agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate the Company’s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights). Under such circumstances the Company may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the website, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
<span class="c-bold">WHAT IS ARBITRATION: </span> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. Thus, you agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to court to secure relief, and instead agree to the arbitration process as stated in this provision. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.
<span class="c-bold">ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: </span> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate, the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. To initiate arbitration, you or the Company must do the following things:
1.	Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.
2.	Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to your local JAMS office.
3.	Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that for claims of less than $1,000, you will be obligated to pay $25 and the Company will pay all other administrative costs and fees. In addition, for claims of less than $1,000, the Company will reimburse you for the $25 fee if the arbitrator rules in your favor. Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States county where you live or work, New York, New York, or any other location we mutually agree to, subject to New York law. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
<span class="c-bold">AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: </span> The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company. The arbitrator’s decision may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction.
<span class="c-bold">NO CLASS ACTIONS: </span> You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.
<span class="c-bold">WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: </span> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.
<span class="c-bold">OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: </span> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing the Company at adroptout@sac.shiseido.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1)Your Name; (2) the URL of Terms and Conditions and Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms and Conditions. The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms and Conditions by using the website.
<span class="c-bold">CHOICE OF LAW/FORUM SELECTION. </span>
In any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law rules. You further expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of a state court of competent jurisdiction located in New York or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the District Court in New York.
<span class="c-bold">11. Entire Agreement</span>
These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between Users and the Company concerning Users’ use of the Program.
<span class="c-bold">12. No Waiver</span>
The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
<span class="c-bold">13. Severability</span>
The provisions of these Terms and Conditions are intended to be interpreted in a manner which makes them valid, legal, and enforceable. In the event any provision of these Terms and Conditions are found to be partially or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provisions shall be modified or restricted to the extent and in the manner necessary to render them valid, legal, and enforceable. It is expressly understood and agreed between the parties that such modification or restriction may be accomplished unilaterally by us, or alternatively, by disposition of a court of law or arbitrator. If such provisions cannot under any circumstances be so modified or restricted, they shall be excised from the Terms and Conditions without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the remaining provisions.
<span class="c-bold">14. Section Titles</span>
The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
<span class="c-bold">15. Third Parties</span>
A person who is not a party to these Terms shall have no right to enforce or receive the benefit of any of these Terms.</p>
